    content: |-
        Being a guy born much late, I always felt like I missed the golden age of technology. But that didn’t stop me from diving headfirst into the world of coding and development. I loved the earlier internet. I loved when people used to share their knowledge without any expectation of return. Nowadays, it feels like everyone is trying to monetize everything and no one is willing to just be their self and share their cool stuff or what they made. And yea I've heard about the indie web and I loved it.

        But from the looks of it, it's only going worsen as AI floods the internet with it's sloppy writing and art. It's lose-lose situation for indie web. Because if the indie web becomes big, it will be flooded with AI generated content and if it doesn't, it will be lost in the sea of AI generated content. And I don't want to see that happen. I want to see the indie web thrive and I want to see people sharing their knowledge and experiences without any expectation of return.

        It's not all bad tho. I'm here to try and change that. I want to share my knowledge, my projects, and my experiences. The section is not really about me, it's about the things I love and the things I want to share with the world. It's about the things that make me who I am. So, if you're here to learn something new, or just to see what I'm up to, I hope you find something that resonates with you.

        I've said a lot about "the golden age of technology" and "the indie web", but I haven't really explained what they are. I will do that in a later post, cause if you remember, you were reading the about section and I got carried away. You'll get this sort of feeling a lot when you read my posts. I tend to get carried away a lot. But that's just me, I guess. I love to write and I love to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. So, if you're here to read my posts, I hope you enjoy them.
